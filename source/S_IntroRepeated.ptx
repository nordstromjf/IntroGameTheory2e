  <title>Introduction to Repeated Games</title>
  <p>
    Now that we are experts at finding equilibrium pairs, what happens when a game doesn't have any equilibrium pairs? What should our players do? As we saw in <xref ref="S_ZeroSumStrategySummary"></xref>, if there is no equilibrium point then no matter which strategies are played, at least one player wants to switch.

    <title>A <m>2\times 2</m> repeated game</title>
    <introduction>
      <p>
        Consider the following zero-sum game
        <me>
          \left[\begin{matrix}1\amp 0\\
          -1\amp 2
          \end{matrix} \right].
        </me>
      </p></introduction>

      <task><p>
        Does this game have an equilibrium pair? </p></task>
        <task><p>
         Play this game with an opponent 10 times. Tally your wins and losses. </p></task>
         <task><p> Describe how you chose which strategy to play. Describe how your opponent chose which strategy to play.
      </p></task>
      <task><p>
    When playing the game several times, does it make sense for either player to play the same strategy all the time? Why or why not?
  </p></task>
  </activity>

  

  <p>
    Up until this point we have used the term <q>strategy</q> to mean which row or column a player chooses to play. Now we want to refer to how a player plays a repeated game as the player's <term>strategy</term><idx><h>strategy, repeated game</h></idx>. In order to avoid confusion, in repeated games we will define some specific strategies.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="D_purestrategy">
    <statement>
      <p>
        In a repeated game, if a player always plays the same row or column, we say that she is playing a <term>pure strategy</term><idx><h>pure strategy</h></idx><idx><h>strategy, pure</h></idx>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    For example, if Player 1 always plays Row A, we say she is playing <term>pure strategy A</term>.
  </p>

  <definition xml:id="D_mixedstrategy">
    <statement>
      <p>
        If a player varies which row or column he plays, then we say he is playing a <term>mixed strategy</term><idx><h>mixed strategy</h></idx><idx><h>strategy, mixed</h></idx>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </definition>

  <p>
    For example, if a player plays Row A 40% of the time and Row B 60% of the time, we will say he is playing a (.4, .6) strategy, as we generally use the probability rather than the percent. The probabilities of each strategy will be listed in the same order as the strategies in the matrix.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is not enough just to determine how often to play a strategy. Suppose Player 1 just alternates rows in <xref ref="E_smallrepeat"></xref>. Can Player 2 <q>out-guess</q> Player 1? What might be a better way for Player 1 to play?
  </p>

  <p>
    We'd really like to find a way to determine the best mixed strategy for each player in a repeated game. Let's start with what we already know: games with equilibrium points. If a game has an equilibrium pair of strategies, would a player want to play a mixed strategy? Recall that a strategy pair is an equilibrium pair if neither player gains by switching strategy.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="E_repeatequil">
    <title>Repeating a Game with an Equilibrium</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the following zero-sum game
        <me>
          \left[\begin{matrix}-1\amp 1\\
          0\amp 2
          \end{matrix} \right].
        </me>
      </p>

      <p>
        This game has an equilibrium pair. Convince yourself that if this game is played repeatedly, each player should choose to play a pure strategy.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </example>

  <p>
    Thus, if the game has an equilibrium we know that players will play the pure strategies determined by the equilibrium pairs. So let's get back to thinking about games without equilibrium pairs. If we play such a game once, can we predict the outcome? What about if we repeat the game several times, can we predict the outcome? Think about tossing a coin. If you toss it once, can you predict the outcome? What if you toss it 100 times, can you predict the outcome? Not exactly, but we can say what we <em>expect</em>: if we toss a coin 100 times we expect to have half of the coins turn up heads and half turn up tails. This may not be the <em>actual</em> outcome, but it is a reasonable prediction. Now is a good time to remind yourself about finding the <term>expected value</term><idx><h>expected value</h></idx>, <xref ref="D_expectedvalue"></xref>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recall the familiar game of Rock-Paper-Scissors<idx><h>Rock-Paper-Scissors</h></idx>: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beat Paper, and Paper beats Rock. Using the payoff matrix and experimentation, we will try to determine the best strategy for this game.

    Hopefully, you concluded that the best strategy against our perfect player would be to play Rock, Paper, Scissors 1/3 of the time each, and to play randomly. We can say that our strategy is to play each option randomly with a probability of 1/3, and call this the Random(1/3, 1/3, 1/3) strategy.

        Let's check our prediction. Using a die, let 1 and 2 represent Rock, 3 and 4 represent Paper, and 5 and 6 represent Scissors. Play the game 20 times with someone in class where each player rolls to determine the choice of Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Keep track of the strategy pairs and payoffs. What was the total payoff for each player? (At this point, if you still feel that you have a better strategy, try your strategy against the random one to see what happens!)

  <p>You may have had an idea about the best way to play Rock-Paper-Scissors before working through this section, but how can we find solutions to other games, such as the one in <xref ref="A_smallrepeatstrat"></xref>?
