  <title>Game Matrices and Payoff Vectors</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      We need a way to describe the possible choices for the players and the outcomes of those choices.
      For now, we will stick with games that have only two players. We will call them Player 1 and Player 2.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="SS_MatchPennies">
    <title>Setting up a Payoff Matrix</title>
    <p>
     We begin with an example of the game of Matching Pennies<idx><h>Matching Pennies</h></idx>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose each player has two choices: Heads (H) or Tails (T). If they choose the same side of the coin, then Player 1 wins $1 from Player 2. If they don't match, then Player 1 loses $1 to Player 2. We can represent all the possible outcomes of the game with a <term>matrix</term><idx><h>game matrix</h></idx><idx><h>matrix</h></idx>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Player 1's options will always correspond to the rows of the matrix, and Player 2's options will correspond to the columns. See <xref ref="T_template"></xref>.

    <definition>
      <statement>
        <p>
          A <term>payoff</term><idx><h>payoff</h></idx> is the amount a player receives for a given outcome of the game.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      Now we can fill in the matrix with each player's payoff. Since the payoffs to each player are different, we will use ordered pairs where the first number is Player 1's payoff and the second number is Player 2's payoff. The ordered pair is called the <term>payoff vector</term><idx><h>payoff vector</h></idx>. For example, if both players choose H, then Player 1's payoff is $1 and Player 2's payoff is -$1 (since he loses to Player 1). Thus the payoff vector associated with the outcome H, H is <m>(1, -1)</m>.
    </p>

      We fill in the matrix with the appropriate payoff vectors in <xref ref="T_matchpennies"></xref>

    <p>
      It is useful to think about different ways to quantify winning and losing. What are some possible measures of value? For example, we could use money, chips, counters, votes, points, amount of cake, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Remember, a player always prefers to win the MOST points (money, chips, votes, cake), not just more than her opponent. If you want to study a game where players simply win or lose (such as Tic Tac Toe), we could just use <q>1</q> for a win and <q>-1</q> for a loss.
    </p>

  <subsection xml:id="SS_revistassump">
    <title>Revisiting the Assumptions</title>
    <p>
    Recall that we said there are two major assumptions we must make about our players:

    <ul>
      <li><p>
          Our players are <em>self-interested</em><idx><h>self-interested</h></idx>. This means they will always prefer the largest  possible payoff. They will choose a strategy which maximizes their payoff.
        </p></li>

      <li><p>
          Our players are <em>perfectly logical</em><idx><h>perfectly logical</h></idx>. This means they will use all the information available and make the choice that results in the largest payoff for themselves.
        </p></li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      It is important to note that each player also knows that his or her opponent is also self-interested and perfectly logical!

    <activity xml:id="A_preferredpayoff">
      <title>Preferred payoffs</title>
      <statement>
        <ol marker="a">
          <li><p>
              Which payoff does a player prefer: 0, 2, or -2?
            </p></li>

          <li><p>
              Which payoff does a player prefer: -2, -5, or -10?

          <li><p>

    </activity>
    <p>
      It may be strightforward to decide the best payoff for a player out of a list of values, and it would be great if a player could just determine the biggest value in the table and choose that strategy. However, when there are two players a player may have to choose a strategy more carefully, since Player 1 can only choose the row, and Player 2 can only choose the column. Thus, the outcome of the game depends on BOTH players.
