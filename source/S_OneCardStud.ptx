  <title>A Game of Chance</title>
  <p>
    Now that we have worked with expected value, we can begin to analyze some simple games that involve an element of chance.
  </p>

  <example xml:id="E_onecardstud">
    <title>One-Card Stud Poker<idx><h>One-Card Stud Poker</h></idx></title>
    <statement>
      

      <p>
        We begin with a deck of cards in which 50% are Aces (you can use Red cards for Aces) and 50% are Kings (you can use Black cards for Kings). There are two players and one dealer. The play begins by each player putting in the ante (1 chip). Each player is dealt one card face down. WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEIR CARD, the players decide to Bet (say, 1 chip) or Fold. Players secretly show the dealer their choice of Bet or Fold. If one player Bets and the other Folds, then the player who Bet wins. If both Bet or both Fold, then Ace beats King (or Red beats Black); winner takes the pot (all the chips from the ante and any bets). If there is a tie, they split the pot.

    Before moving on, you should attempt to determine the payoff matrix. The remainder of this section will be more meaningful if you have given some thought to what the payoff matrix should be. It is OK to be wrong at this point, it is not OK to not try.

  <p>
    Now let's work through creating the payoff matrix for One-Card Stud Poker.
  </p>
  <activity xml:id="A_payoffBF">
    <title>Payoff for [Bet, Fold]</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If Player 1 Bets and Player 2 Folds, does it matter which cards were dealt? How much does Player 1 win? How much does Player 2 lose? What is the payoff vector for [Bet, Fold]? (Keep in mind your answer to <xref ref="A_onecardzerosum"></xref>.)

  <activity xml:id="A_payoffandactual">
    <title>Payoff and the actual deal</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        If both players Bet, does the payoff depend on which cards were dealt?
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>
  <p>
    To determine the payoff vector for [Bet, Bet] and [Fold, Fold] we will need to consider which cards were dealt. We can use some probability to determine the remaining payoff vectors.
  </p>
  <activity xml:id="A_probofdeal">
    <title>Probability of each deal</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        There are four possible outcomes of the deal (what cards could have been dealt to each player?). List them. What is the probability that each occurs? Remember, the probability of an event is a number between 0 and 1.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>
  <activity xml:id="A_BBpayoffperdeal">
    <title>Payoff for each deal with [Bet, Bet]</title>
    <statement>
      <p>
        Consider the pair of strategies [Bet, Bet]. For each possible deal, determine the payoff vector. For example, if the players are each dealt an Ace (Red), how much does each player win? Again, keep in mind your answer to <xref ref="A_onecardzerosum"></xref>.
      </p>
    </statement>
  </activity>
  <p>
    In order to calculate the payoff for [Bet, Bet], we need to take a weighted average of the possible payoff vectors in <xref ref="A_BBpayoffperdeal"></xref>. In particular, we will <q>weight</q> a payoff by the probability that it occurs. Recall that this is the <term>expected value</term><idx><h>expected value</h></idx>, <xref ref="D_expectedvalue"></xref>. We will calculate the expected value separately for each player.

  <p>Now that you have done all the hard work of finding the payoff matrix for One-Card Stud Poker, we can analyze our two-player zero-sum game using the techniques we learned in the previous sections. It is also important to see how the mathematical solution compares to our conjectured solution from <xref ref="A_onecardconjecturestrat"></xref>.</p>

  <p>Since One-Card Stud Poker has an element of chance, we should see what happens if we play the game several times using the strategy from <xref ref="A_onecardstrategy"></xref>.</p>
  <activity xml:id="A_onecardlongrun">

<p>For more of a challenge with probability, you can think about what happens if we change the number of Kings in the deck.</p>

  <p>Now that we have analyzed several zero-sum games, we can see how important it is to find any equilibrium pairs. In the next section we explore equilibrium strategies in more detail.</p>
