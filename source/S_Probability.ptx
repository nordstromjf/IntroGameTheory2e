  <title>Probability and Expected Value</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      Many games have an element of chance. In order to model such games and determine strategies, we should understand how mathematicians use probability to represent chance.
    </p>
  </introduction>

  <subsection xml:id="SS_basicprob">
    <title>Some Basic Probability</title><idx><h>probability</h></idx>
   

    <p>
      You are probably a little bit familiar with the idea of probability. People often talk about the chance of some event happening. For example, a weather forecast might say there is a 20% chance of rain. Determining the chance of rain can be difficult, so we will stick with some easier examples.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consider a standard deck of 52 playing cards. What is the chance of drawing a red card? What is the probability of drawing a red card? Is there a difference between chance and probability? Yes! The probability of an event has a very specific meaning in mathematics.</p>
   

    <definition xml:id="D_probability">
      <p>The <term>probability</term><idx><h>probability</h></idx> of an event <m>E</m> is the number of different outcomes resulting in <m>E</m> divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes. In mathematical symbols,
      <me>
        P(E)=\frac{\mbox{number of different outcomes resulting in \(E\)} }{\mbox{total number of equally likely outcomes} }.
      </me>
    </p></definition>

    <p>
      Notice that the probability of <m>E</m> will always be a number between 0 and 1. An impossible event will have probability 0; an event that always occurs will have probability 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Returning to our standard deck of 52 playing cards, the probability of drawing a red card is <m>\frac{1}{2}</m>, not 50%. Although we can convert between probability and percent (since <m>0.5</m> converted to percent is <m>50\%</m>), it is important to answer a question about probability with a probability, not a percent.
    </p>

    <example xml:id="E_drawheart">
      <title>Drawing a Particular Suit</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Given a standard deck of playing cards, what is the probability of drawing a heart?
        </p></statement>
          <answer><p> You might say since there are four suits, and one of the suits is hearts, you have a probability of <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>. You'd be correct, but be careful with this reasoning. This works because each suit has the same number of cards, so each suit is <term>equally likely</term><idx><h>equally likely events</h></idx>. Another way the calculate the probability is to count the number of hearts (13) divided by the number of cards (52). Thus, we get a probability of <m>\frac{13}{52}=\frac{1}{4}=0.25</m>.
        </p></answer>
     
    </example>

    <example xml:id="E_takeawayspade">
      <title>A Card is Missing</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Now suppose the ace of spades is missing from the deck. What is the probability of drawing a heart?
        </p></statement>

        <answer><p>
          As before, there are still four suits in the deck, so it might be tempting to say the probability is still <m>\frac{1}{4}</m>. But we'd be wrong! Each suit is no longer equally likely since, it is slightly <em>less</em> likely that we draw a spade. Each individual card is still equally likely, though. So now
          <me>
            P(\mbox{drawing a heart} )= \frac{\mbox{number of hearts} }{\mbox{number of cards} }=\frac{13}{51}= 0.255.
          </me>
        </p>

        <p>
          As you can see, it is now slightly more likely that we draw a heart if the ace of spades is removed from the deck.
        </p>

      It is important to note that just because you can list all of the possible outcomes, they may not be equally likely.

  <subsection xml:id="SS_expectedvalue">
    <title>Expected Value</title><idx><h>expected value</h></idx>
   
<p>Now that we have defined the probability for an outcome, we need a way to calculate payoffs for games of chance.</p>
    <definition xml:id="D_expectedvalue">
      <statement>
        <p>
          The <term>expected value</term><idx><h>expected value</h></idx> of a game of chance is the average net gain or loss that we would expect per game if we played the game many times. We compute the expected value by multiplying the value of each outcome by its probability of occurring and then add up all of the products.
        </p>
      </statement>
    </definition>

    <p>
      For example, suppose you toss a fair coin. If it lands on Heads, you win 25 cents. If it lands on Tails, you lose 25 cents. The probability of getting Heads is <m>1/2</m>, as is the probability of getting Tails. The expected value of the game is
      <me>
        \biggl(\frac{1}{2}\times .25\biggr)+\biggl(\frac{1}{2}\times(- .25)\biggr)=0.
      </me>
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, you would expect an average payoff of $0, if you were to play the game several times. Note, the expected value is not necessarily the actual value of playing the game.

          <p>
              Is there a single possible outcome where you would actually win or lose the exact amount computed for the expected value? If not, why do we call it the expected value?
