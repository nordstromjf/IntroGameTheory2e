<div class="para">Now we can fill in the matrix with each player’s payoff. Since the payoffs to each player are different, we will use ordered pairs where the first number is Player 1’s payoff and the second number is Player 2’s payoff. The ordered pair is called the <dfn class="terminology">payoff vector</dfn>. For example, if both players choose H, then Player 1’s payoff is $1 and Player 2’s payoff is -$1 (since he loses to Player 1). Thus the payoff vector associated with the outcome H, H is <span class="process-math">\((1, -1)\text{.}\)</span>
