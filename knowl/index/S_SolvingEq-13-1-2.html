<div class="para">Determine Player 1’s maximin mixed strategy. Recalling that <span class="process-math">\(p\)</span> is the probability that Player 1 plays <span class="process-math">\(B\text{,}\)</span> we know that Player 1 will play <span class="process-math">\(B\)</span> with probability 1/4, and thus, play A with probability 3/4. The expected payoff for Player 1, <span class="process-math">\(m\text{,}\)</span> is 1/2. It is important to check the algebraic solution with where the intersection point appears on the graph. Although we are using technology to help us graph and solve for the intersection point, we need to be able to catch any errors we make entering the information into Sage.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="S_SolvingEq.html#S_SolvingEq-13-1-2">in-context</a></span>
