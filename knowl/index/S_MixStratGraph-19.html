<div class="para">Now we have this nice graph, but what does it really tell us? Although we drew lines representing each of Player 2’s pure strategies, Player 1 doesn’t know what Player 2 will do. Suppose Player 1 only played A, while Player 2 plays an unknown mixed strategy. Then the possible payoffs for Player 1 are 1 or 0. The more often Player 2 plays C, the more often Player 1 gets 1. So the <em class="emphasis">expected payoff</em> per game for a repeated game varies between 0 and 1. We can see the possible expected values as the red line on the graph in <a href="S_MixStratGraph.html#F_BoldA" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/F_BoldA.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Figure 3.2.5">Figure 3.2.5</a>.</div>
