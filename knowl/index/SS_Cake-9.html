<div class="para">But what does it mean to win? A player’s <dfn class="terminology">payoff</dfn> is the amount (points, money, or anything a player values) a player receives for a particular outcome of a game. We say that the player’s goal is to maximize his or her payoff. We should note that the maximum payoff for a player might even be negative, in which case the player wants the least negative (or closest to 0) payoff.</div>
