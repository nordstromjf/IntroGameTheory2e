<div class="para">We begin with a deck of cards in which 50% are Aces (you can use Red cards for Aces) and 50% are Kings (you can use Black cards for Kings). There are two players and one dealer. The play begins by each player putting in the ante (1 chip). Each player is dealt one card face down. WITHOUT LOOKING AT THEIR CARD, the players decide to Bet (say, 1 chip) or Fold. Players secretly show the dealer their choice of Bet or Fold. If one player Bets and the other Folds, then the player who Bet wins. If both Bet or both Fold, then Ace beats King (or Red beats Black); winner takes the pot (all the chips from the ante and any bets). If there is a tie, they split the pot.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="S_OneCardStud.html#E_onecardstud">in-context</a></span>
