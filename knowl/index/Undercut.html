<div class="para">Each player chooses a number 1 through 5. If the two numbers don’t differ by 1, then each player adds their own number to their score. If the two numbers differ by 1, then the player with the <em class="emphasis">lower</em> number adds <em class="emphasis">both</em> numbers to their score; the player with the higher number gets nothing. (This game is from Douglas Hofstadter’s <span class="booktitle">Metamagical Themas</span>.)</div> <div class="para">For example, suppose in round one Player 1 chooses 4, and Player 2 chooses 4. Each player keeps their own number. The score is now 4-4. In the next round, Player 1 chooses 2, and Player 2 chooses 5. The score would now be 6-9. In the third round Player 1 chooses 4, and Player 2 chooses 5. Now Player 1 gets <em class="emphasis">both</em> numbers, while Player 2 gets nothing, making the score 15-9.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="S_Undercut.html#Undercut">in-context</a></span>
