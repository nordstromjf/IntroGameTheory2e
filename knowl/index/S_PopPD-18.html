<div class="para">An example of a Volunteer’s Dilemma can be seen starting in Season 41 of <span class="booktitle">Survivor</span>  (2021). Three contestants must decide to “Protect” their vote or “Risk” their vote. Their vote is very valuable in the game. If all three contestants choose Protect, they all keep their votes. If at least one contestant chooses to Protect her vote, then all three keep their votes and any contestants who chose Risk get an extra vote. If all three choose Risk, they all lose their vote.</div>
