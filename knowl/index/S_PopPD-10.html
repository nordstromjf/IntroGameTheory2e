<div class="para">In the film <span class="booktitle">Crazy Rich Asians</span> (2018), after getting engaged to Nick, Rachel is in a battle of wills with her future Mother-in-Law, Eleanor. In one scene, Rachel explicitly describes the battle as a game of Chicken. Both Rachel and Eleanor want the other to “swerve” and back out of Nick’s life (or at least stop controlling it so much). They are determined to show their strength by not backing down (going “straight”). If neither back down it is clear that they will both lose Nick.</div>
