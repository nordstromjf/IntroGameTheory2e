<div class="para">We begin with a deck of cards which has 50% Aces (A) and 50% Kings (K) and two players. Aces rank higher than Kings.</div> <div class="para">Player 1 is dealt one card, face down. Player 1 can look at the card, but does not show the card to Player 2. Player 1 then says “Ace” or “King” depending on what his card is. Player 1 can either tell the truth and say what the card is (T), or he can bluff and say that he has a higher ranking card (B). Note that if Player 1 has an Ace, he must tell the truth since there are no higher ranking cards. However, if he is dealt a King, he can bluff by saying he has an Ace.</div> <div class="para">If Player 1 says “King” the game ends and both players break even. If Player 1 says “Ace” then Player 2 can either call (C) or fold (F). If Player 2 folds, then Player 1 wins $0.50. If Player 2 calls and Player 1 does not have an Ace, then Player 2 wins $1. If Player 2 calls and Player 1 does have an Ace, then Player 1 wins $1.</div></article><span class="incontext"><a class="internal" href="S_LiarsPoker.html#G_liarspoker">in-context</a></span>
