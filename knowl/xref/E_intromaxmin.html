<div class="para">Assume you are Player 1, and you are playing against this “infinitely smart” Player 2. Consider the game in <a href="S_DominatedStrategies.html#T_domstratpractice1" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/xref/T_domstratpractice1.html" data-reveal-label="Reveal" data-close-label="Close" title="Table 2.2.17: Payoff matrix for Exercise 2.2.16.">Table 2.2.17</a>. If you pick row A, what will Player 2 do? Player 2 will pick column X or Y. Try this for each of the rows. Which row is your best choice? If you pick A, you will get <span class="process-math">\(0\text{;}\)</span> if you pick B, you will get <span class="process-math">\(-2\text{;}\)</span> if you pick C, you will get <span class="process-math">\(1\text{;}\)</span> and if you pick D you will get <span class="process-math">\(-2\text{.}\)</span> Thus, your best choice is to choose C and get <span class="process-math">\(1\text{.}\)</span> Now assume you are Player 2, and Player 1 is “infinitely smart.” Which column is your best choice? If you pick W, Player 1 will get <span class="process-math">\(1\)</span> (you will get <span class="process-math">\(-1\)</span>); if you pick X, Player 1 will get <span class="process-math">\(1\text{;}\)</span> if you pick Y, Player 1 will get <span class="process-math">\(1\text{;}\)</span> and if you pick Z, you will get <span class="process-math">\(10\text{.}\)</span> Thus, you can choose W, X, or Y (since you want Player 1 to win the least) and get <span class="process-math">\(-1\text{.}\)</span>
